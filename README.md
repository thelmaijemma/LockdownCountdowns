# LockdownCountdowns
Every few weeks England lifts a new set of coronavirus restrictions. One of the strictest lockdowns in the world, so this is a really big deal! I made a website that is also a great template if you quickly want to make a page with several countdown bootstrap  carousels with generous CSS effects to fade the images. Here is the link. One of the more simple things I have built, but it's gotten a lot of use. https://lockdowncountdowns.thelmaijemma.repl.co
